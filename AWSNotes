Bucket Name should be DNS - Compliant.
Bucket Name is unique across all of AWS Buckets
Bucket Name once created cannot be changed.
If Bucket is deleted, the name is available for resuse, but it may not happen immediately.
Though Buckets has to reside in a region, the name should be unique across all regions
Buckets store objects . Objects can be a folder, file, photo, zip file etc

By Default, buckets are private, only the AWS account owner can access data uploaded to Amazon S3. 

Bucket creation is free, no charges incurred. Charges are only incurred when objects are stored and transfer of data out.
