Computer Networking
The primary function of networking is to communicate between computers or devices.

Hosts are refered to a computers who are source or destination of the communication. 
There is a server who provides the info or data. Client is the one consuming or requesting data.

There could be number of intermedidate devices to facilatate this communication. They could be routers, hubs, switches.

Internet is a network of networks, not controlled,owned by anybody but rather works on cooperation and sharing. 
e.g. in a country you have o from point A to point B. Delhi to Mumbai. You can take different roads to reach from Delhi
to Mumbai. Some  roads are maintained by NHAI, Some by state governments, some by private companies, some by community etc.

So your packet starts a journey from your computer and reaches its destination on the destionation PC. Every packet can take 
different paths.


The cooperating thing we talked about in networks relies on protocols. 
Protocol is a set of rules for communication. Since every network is different, every computer in the network is different.
In order to communicate they adhere to some common rules, we can call the set of rules as protocols.

A communication may involve multiple protocols eg TCP / IP, used by the internet has both protocols TCP and IP protocols
together to achieve reliable communication.
