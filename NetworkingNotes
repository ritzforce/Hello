Computer Networking
The primary function of networking is to communicate between computers or devices.

Hosts are refered to a computers who are source or destination of the communication. 
There is a server who provides the info or data. Client is the one consuming or requesting data.

There could be number of intermedidate devices to facilatate this communication. They could be routers, hubs, switches.

Internet is a network of networks, not controlled,owned by anybody but rather works on cooperation and sharing. 
e.g. in a country you have o from point A to point B. Delhi to Mumbai. You can take different roads to reach from Delhi
to Mumbai. Some  roads are maintained by NHAI, Some by state governments, some by private companies, some by community etc.

So your packet starts a journey from your computer and reaches its destination on the destionation PC. Every packet can take 
different paths.


The cooperating thing we talked about in networks relies on protocols. 
Protocol is a set of rules for communication. Since every network is different, every computer in the network is different.
In order to communicate they adhere to some common rules, we can call the set of rules as protocols.

A communication may involve multiple protocols eg TCP / IP, used by the internet has both protocols TCP and IP protocols
together to achieve reliable communication.

Bandwidth is the maximum capacity of the channel that facilates the communication. similar to roads which can be different types
eg metalled roads, concrete roads, mud roads. Channel can be of different types wires, wireless, fibreoptic etc

Now since the information in computers in stored and transmitted as bits. A bit is zero or 1. This information needs to 
transferred via physical medium which have limits. Bandwidth is the max amount of data that can be transferred.
Its measured in bits per second. It could kbps / Mbps / Gbps 

Throughtput is actual data passed on through the medium. Well Bandwidth is the theory and throughtput is the practical. Its like 
check your car dashboard. Your car bandwidth is 200 Km / hr, but throughput is likely 100 km/ hr, that on a highway.
