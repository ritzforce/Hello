Leverage and Optimize Performance

1.Align Individual and Team Goals together
eg Parade 
eg everybody rowing in the same direction

overcommunicate, and let individuals internalize the goals
always emphasize, when discussing company level goals, how individual goal have contributed to it

eg revenue numbers by department, each person should be able to relate how much he contributed
reward behavior that helps in achieving company goals

2.Define and Understand the problem
We need a bigger office ? is not a problem 
the problem is some of the employees don't have a place to sit

3.Clearly state the problem
stomach hurts complain to the doctor, will lead to a zillion of followup questions
a specific problem, the pain is from navel to lower-right abdomen is a sign of appendictics

who,why,how,where and when of the problem
support by concrete facts and numbers

"sales are going down",fairly generic won't help anything "sales have gone down by 10% in last 3 months in APAC",now thats a problem

4.Create key Strategic Objective
Goals are the destination you want to reach
Objectives are the measures you take

eg. Goal is to reach delhi
objectives will be : book tickets
pack luggage
inform neighbours etc

objectives will have milestones
eg book tickets 1 month prior to departure
pack luggage 1 night before etc

5.Strategic Thinking
Thinking ahead, having a vision

6.Gain values from value
outline behaviors that capture your values eg treating customer with respect means personally calling them, if they are unsatisfied
recognize and reward behaviour that aligns with the company values

7.Recognize Strategic Leadership
you need both a long term vision and as well as day to day operations
Strategic leadership is striking a balance between the 2.

8.Metrics for Strategic Leadership
Have quantifiable metrics, sensibly based on your long term and short term goals
Metrics can be leading (that show the future) eg bookings
trailing (that show the past) revenue generated last quarter

9.Strategic Thinking
Cannot win every state in a presidential election. Pick your battles carefully 
Use your strength

10.Make the company align to the Strategic Thinking and Goals
If we are focused on launching our product next year, put your best engineering horse power in it.

11.Action Plan
Resources, budget, deadlines 

12. Good strategy, 
everybody understands and can articulate it without thinking

Decision making
Once you make a decision,immediately act on it. eg sitting on a job offer is not good. if yes, send letter of acceptance/denial.

Analytical
Conceptual
Behavorial

Coginitive Bias
a) Gambler's Fallacy
b) Status Quo Bias
