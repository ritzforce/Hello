Welcome to the Lightning Experience Customer Enablement Pack!


1. This is a set of resources to help you roll out Lightning Experience.

2. These files will be updated leading up to and beyond Dreamforce. 

3. Each file has a version number in the file name (e.g., "v1").

4. If you see an updated version number, there's been an update to the content!

5. As updated versions of files become available, we'll post an announcement in the Trailhead group on the Success Community.

6. The Trailhead group is available for anyone to join: https://success.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F9300000009Nek

7. There are two updated files as of October 2015 - look for the ones marked v2 and v3 - and one new file (Lightning Experience Logo).


Good luck with your Lightning Experience rollout!
