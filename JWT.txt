JWT => JSON Web token
An encrypted string containing header,payload is stored in the localStorage.
To access the apis, it is passed in the http header.

Advantages
a) Works in Mobile browsers, apps as localStorage is better supported than cookies
b) client can restart, and as long as the token is valid, doesn't have to relogin
c) Encrypts user data, and doesn't need a database/memory lookup on the user, hence bit efficient
